#Process
I used this as an intro to jQuery! It's a bit outdated, but I wanted to get the fundamentals down before I move to more complicated libraries like React :)
I wanted to create a typing game where users could try and type given paragraphs as fast as they could. The raceing theme came from that, and the idea of having to "beat the clock".
I leaned into that theme a lot, with the red yellow and green for difficulties, as well as on the stoplight which is used to communicate with the user if they've entered the wrong character.
For the three difficulty levels, I used ChatGPT to produce the text. Easy is 50 words, Medium is 100 words, and Hard is 100 words with more complex syntax and sentence structure.
Additionally, I built a stopwatch to track the seconds by creating a class for it with methods for things like stopping, restarting, and starting. Good practice of OOP :P

#Future updates
- Leaderboard system!
- More tests
- More game modes
- and much more!
